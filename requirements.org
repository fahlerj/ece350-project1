#+TITLE: Requirements & Optionals for ECE350 Project

* Hard Requirements [3/4] [75%]
 - [X] The RPI 4b shall be used
 - [X] A temperature sensor shall be used to read and display the temperature in degrees F to an output device
 - [X] The output device shall be a multi digit seven-segment display, or a Liquid Crystal Display
   - If a LCD is used, it shall use the I2C interface standard
 - [ ] There shall be a stepper motor utilized with a "hand" to point to the temperature on a fixed position
   - [ ] The stepper motor will "calibrate" to zero on program init by turning and a limit switch will be actuated

* Soft (Optional) Requirements [0/3] [0%]
 - [ ] If time permits, implement extended functionality to switch between degrees C and F (F is a base requirement)
   - This would be completed by a push-button or another switching mechanism
 - [ ] If time permits, implement auto-run functionality such that the program runs at boot
   - This would be implemented by a systemd service
 - [ ] If time permits, create a 3d printable case to hold all components

* Planned Resources [5/7] [71%]
- [X] Raspberry Pi 4b
- [X] LCD 1602A
- [X] Adeept I2C module for LCD 1602A
- [X] DS18B20 Temperature Module
- [ ] Slide Switch
- [ ] Push button
- [X] Adeept Lesson 31 and associated python code
